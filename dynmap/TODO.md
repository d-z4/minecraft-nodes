# TODO

## Super High
- Custom Warning system for editor
  - a build in warning system would be super useful to tell admins why their x is broken (x being world.json, town.json, town they created, nation ect).

## High Priority:
- make an editor for ports on webmap (editor will be in global options pane).
- make outposts show on the map with a toggle button like ports. | might not be posible depending on how logic for outposts is stored
- make an editor for outposts on webmap (editor will be in global options pane). | might not be posible depending on how logic for outposts is stored
- Built in Tier system (needs plugin feature coded first).


## Medium:
- Shift + Right clicking a selected node will unselect it.
- make outposts show on the map with a toggle button like ports.
- add more info to resource node tooltip | attack time, liberation time, etc.
## Low:
- add a search bar to search towns by name | Not super needed at all.


## Super Low:
- Proper Mobile support.
- Add rendering chunks being captured during war from war json file. | could be laggy? (also super op, maybe indicate if the node is under attack with an icon?)
- Territory cost overlay editor.
- Territory territory id overlay editor.
- add more options to toggle on/off for territory rendering | maybe?
- add an option to upload a save into a file on the local server | password protected, admin only, maybe?
  Super low because I dont know how to add this yet.
