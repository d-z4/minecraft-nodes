# TODO
- Make mobile support | fix: just use landscape (sideways)
- Add rendering chunks being captured during war from war json file. | could be laggy? (also super op, maybe indicate if the node is under attack with an icon?)
- Add town editing panel, to edit towns data in editor ? this is already a thing no?
(add/remove territories, increase territory tier, create pre-made towns, etc...).
- Shift + Right clicking a selected node will unselect it
